### INTRODUCTION

An app has been developed for event management. It includes different phases of the event which are usually done through spreadsheet. 

The pioneers very well know how much effort and time it takes to manage each and everything from the word go. Seeing the hurdles of managing events in my university me and my colleagues produced a web application that we believe is an attempt to make the process slightly easier. The app is called Eventia.
